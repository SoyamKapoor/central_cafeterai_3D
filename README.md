# Central Cafeteria 3D Model

Welcome to the **Central Cafeteria 3D Model** project! This is a **3D Model** of the real Central Cafeteria of **Sukkur IBA University**, created using **Autodesk AutoCAD**. The model represents a detailed and accurate design of the cafeteria, giving a realistic and immersive view of the space.

## Features

1. **3D Visualization**: The model provides a detailed 3D view of the Central Cafeteria, showcasing its architectural layout.
2. **Realistic Design**: The 3D model closely resembles the real cafeteria at Sukkur IBA University, offering a realistic depiction of the space.
3. **Interactive Navigation**: The model allows for easy navigation to explore different areas of the cafeteria in 3D.
4. **Autodesk AutoCAD**: The model is built using AutoCAD, ensuring high precision and detailed architectural design.

## How It Works

The **3D Model** is created using **Autodesk AutoCAD**, a professional CAD software. The design of the cafeteria is based on the actual layout and structure of the cafeteria at **Sukkur IBA University**.

- The model includes various components such as tables, seating arrangements, kitchens, entrances, and more.
- The 3D model is designed to provide an accurate representation of the cafeteria’s architecture, allowing you to explore it digitally.

### Features in the Model

1. **Detailed Layout**: View the complete cafeteria layout, including rooms, seating, and other amenities.
2. **Realistic Representation**: The model reflects the actual design and structure of the cafeteria in a 3D space.
3. **Precision**: Built with high accuracy using Autodesk AutoCAD, ensuring all dimensions and layouts are precise.
